            <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, 
                or other spices of choice</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>It seriously only takes mere minutes to make restaurant-quality 
        hamburgers from scratch. Prep your workspace and ingredients 
        before getting started and you'll be whipping out hot plates 
        from your home kitchen (or backyard) in no time!</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, 
                    crushed crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.</li>
                <li>Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. 
                    Use a knife to cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 
                    6 - 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle 
                    patties.</li>
                <li>Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, 
                    approximately 350-400 degrees F.</li>
            </ol>
