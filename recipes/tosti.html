    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Famous Dutch food writer Johannes van Dam called it 'The 
        national caf√© and barfood for the last centuries'. And he was 
        so right. The tosti is a warm comfort on a rainy day, a cheap 
        lunch for Dutch students and a quick fix when you stayed at 
        a bar too long and forgot to eat. For it is so common, the tosti 
        is often forgotten to be mentioned in food blogs and websites. 
        But not on Odin food recipes! Praise to the tosti and a wiki, 
        because this toasted goodness deserves a blog.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>The original dutch recepe is without the pineapple but we like to
            make a variation. You can also leave out the pineapple if you prefer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 white bread</li>
            <li>2 slices of ham</li>
            <li>2 slices of cheese</li>
            <li>2 slices of canned pineapple</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, arrange the cheese, ham and pineapple 
                    between the slices of bread.</li>
                <li>Next, Melt a tablespoon of butter in a non-stick 
                    skillet and place the sandwich in the middle of the 
                    pan on low heat. When the bottom side of the 
                    sandwich is golden brown, carefully flip it over. </li>
                <li>Then, Continue to fry until the other side is now 
                    brown to. Remove from pan.</li>
                <li> Cut in half, dip in ketchup and eat. Enjoy this
