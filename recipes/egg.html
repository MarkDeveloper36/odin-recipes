    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This method for making fried eggs lies somewhere between the 
        techniques for Spanish fried eggs and for classic sunny side up: 
        The edges are crispy and golden, the whites are set, yet the 
        yolk is still runny. To achieve this contrast in textures, the 
        eggs are cooked in a thin layer of rippling-hot oil. While this 
        recipe is written for four eggs, it will work with any number. 
        (Adjust the pan size and oil accordingly). Avoid touching the 
        eggs until the bottoms and edges are lacy and crisp. Once that 
        happens, spoon some of the oil onto the whites until cooked 
        through. The yolk remains untouched, ready to be sopped up by 
        toast or potatoes, or with yogurt.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, in a medium (10-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet, 
                    heat the olive oil over medium-high until it ripples 
                    like the ocean. (This can take 2 to 2 1/2 minutes).</li>
                <li>Next, crack the eggs into the pan. To minimize splatters and 
                    spreading, open the shell near the oil (not from high up), and 
                    slowly let the egg pour out of the shell. Leave the eggs 
                    untouched until the edges are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then, gently tilt the pan towards you, spoon up some of the 
                    oil, and baste just the whites and edges of the yolk until 
                    the whites are set, about 1 minute. (Avoid the yolk so that 
                    it stays runny). Turn off the heat, season with salt 
                    and pepper, then transfer the eggs to plates using a spoon 
                    or slotted spatula.</li>
            </ol>
